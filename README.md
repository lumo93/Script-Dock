# Script-Dock
A simple Python script using tkinter, and subprocess to start scripts from a GUI window


Has only been tested with one looping script at a time (Anything that is running until the task is completed)

Any subscripts can be a one of function, like deleting a file, or it can open another gui script.

There are many more things you could probably do with this, but I haven't done extensive testing to know the full capabilities, and someone might have already made something better.
